Basic, simple (beta) debugger plugin for redcar editor.

It lacks:
- Variables, eval, and call stack information.
- Conditional breakpoints.

It has:
- Ruby debugger integrated in a REPL tab (variables, eval, conditional breakpoints... and much more).
- ToolBar debug buttons: debug, next, step, continue and list.
- Tags current line in editor tab.

Done:
- Running from ~/.redcar/plugins
- Breakpoint toolbar sets breakpoint.

Working in:
- Toggle breakpoint.
- Breakpoint persistence between restarts.

If you use rdebug, probably this is more than you ever needed.
If you use Netbeans or Rubymine, this could seem like a wombat against a sabretooth. 
If you use Redcar, take a look at http://blog.bithug.org/2011/04/redcar-debug, it's far more advanced than this project.

Why would you like to test this plugin?
- It gives access to the rdebug command line power: conditional breakpoints, frames...
- It makes rdebug easier to use.
- It's small and hackable. You can add your own commands or support to new languages. 

If you still want to install this:
- Install ruby-debug gem.
- Download and copy the spray folder to your redcar plugins folder.
- Restart redcar, and you can see the new buttons in the redcar ToolBar.
